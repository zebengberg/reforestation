      Tree growth rates evolve over time. 
      A tree with a lighter color has a faster growth rate. 
      Growth rates are passed on from parent to child. 
      Spontaneous disasters arise occasionally, killing all trees within a circle. 
      The plot shows the average growth rate of each species over time.
